The manufactured case consists of three parts: the front panel, the center panel, and the rear panel.

I've wanted to make one myself for a long time, but when I first started working with Arduino, I couldn't seem to get the sample sketches to work...
Recently, I've finally been able to understand the contents of the sketches. Since it became like this, I modified it a little and added functions, and modeled the case with CAD and made it as a Mini Weather Station.

I think the finished product turned out to be quite stylish and cool!
